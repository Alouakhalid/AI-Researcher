Mathematics Visualization with Python
📌 Project Overview

This project is a mathematics-focused Jupyter Notebook designed to visualize mathematical concepts using Python.
The main objective is to bridge the gap between theoretical mathematics and computational understanding through clear, interactive visualizations.

The notebook demonstrates how mathematical equations—especially functions of one and two variables—can be represented geometrically, which is fundamental in data science, machine learning, optimization, and artificial intelligence.

🎯 Goals of the Project

Transform abstract mathematical equations into intuitive visual representations

Strengthen mathematical intuition using computational tools

Provide a practical foundation for concepts used in AI and ML

Serve as an educational and research-oriented reference
